## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the creative direction, aesthetic intent, and
thematic identity of the *archeotech-dotfiles* project. It is written to understand the visual tone, influences, and stylistic intent behind all future configuration work.

It contains no technical configuration, only the creative vision that
should guide all technical outputs.

## 1. Persona Context: "Corvus"

-   Persona inspired by Corvus Corax, Raven Guard themes, and stealth--hunter archetypes.
-   Prefers stealthy, elegant, ritualistic technology.
-   Aesthetic combines solemn ritual, disciplined precision, and futuristic stealth operations.
-   Appreciates dark, quiet UIs with subtle ceremonial or symbolic       elements.
-   Blends ancient liturgy with high technology: a cyber‑monastic, techno‑ritual vibe.

AI assistants working for Corvus should prioritize: 
- atmosphere and cohesion 
- subtle symbolism 
- calm, efficient layouts 
- minimalism with lore-driven character

## 2. Core Foundation Theme: Catppuccin Macchiato

**This is the global base theme.**

Properties: 
- Dark, soft, elegant color palette 
- Universally implemented across Hyprland, Waybar, Terminal, GTK, icons 
- Ensures consistency and aesthetic stability

Why Macchiato: 
- Works as a neutral visual foundation 
- Supports additional thematic layering (WH40K, Gundam, Cyberpunk) 
- Perfect for stealth/hunter themes

Focus colors: 
- Purples and violets as primary accents\
(important: purple/mauve accent; matches Shadow Spears heraldry) 
- Secondary accents: pinks, soft blue, muted teal

UI foundation features: 
- Rounded corners
- Soft blur/translucency
- Darkened backgrounds
- Light, intentional accent color usage

## 3. The Aesthetic Blend

The project merges three distinct influences, interpreted in a
controlled, consistent way.

### 3.1 Warhammer 40K -- Shadow Spears / Raven Guard Inspiration

Core concepts: 
- Stealth and shadow 
- Ritual, litany, sacred technology 
- Markings, sigils, purity symbolism (non-religious gothic flavor) 
- Tactical operator discipline

Stylistic cues AI should use: 
- Purples, violets, and shadow tones 
- Minimal iconography (ravens, spears, wings, geometric "sigils") 
- Inactive windows gently dimmed 
- Terminology like *codex*, *liturgy*, *rite*, *archive*, *initiation*, *proclamation*

### 3.2 Gundam -- Cockpit HUD & Mecha Systems

Core concepts: 
- Mecha pilot interfaces
- Structured data panels
- Blueprint-like or schematic visuals
- Precision, clarity, mechanical logic

Stylistic cues: 
- Segmented layouts, cockpit/HUD organization 
- Neon edges (subtle) 
- Technical grid alignment 
- Clean geometry and panel divisions

### 3.3 Cyberpunk -- Controlled Neon & Tech-Noir

Core concepts: 
- Futuristic noir aesthetics 
- Neon-glass reflections 
- Layered interfaces 
- Digital glitch or distortion motifs (subtle)

Stylistic cues: 
- Transparency with blur 
- Subtle neon (purple, blue,teal) 
- Minimal glitch patterns in backgrounds 
- Notification stylingreminiscent of cyberdeck popups

## 4. Unified Aesthetic Identity

All elements should feel like part of one coherent world:

A stealth‑operator's cyber‑monastic desktop:\
A fusion of ritual technology, mecha‑cockpit precision, and soft neon
futurism---anchored in Catppuccin Macchiato.

The atmosphere should evoke: 
- a tactical altar of data
- a hunter's command shrine
- a pilot's interface
- a cyberpunk ritual terminal

Never chaotic.\
Always deliberate, functional, and reverent.

## 5. Identity Markers (AI Can Use These)

Hostname: `archeotech`\
User: `corvus`

Example of textual elements AI may incorporate, these are all for inspiration, other ones can be proposed or alternatives: 
- "ARCHEOTECH-OS" 
- "Corvus: rites verified" 
- "Shadow Protocol Active" 
- "Codex routines synchronized" 
- "Subsystem: mecha‑interface layer"
- "Neon‑Liturgy Node Online"

Tone should remain calm, ritualistic, and technical.

## 6. UI Direction for AI Agents

### General Rules

1.  Always default to Catppuccin Macchiato color palette.
2.  Use **mauve** as the main accent color (Shadow Spears theme).
3.  Maintain stealth/hunter mood (dark, minimal, atmospheric).
4.  Add WH40K/Gundam/cyberpunk elements **sparingly**.
5.  Avoid clutter.
6.  Use geometric spacing and HUD-like separators.
7.  Create a sense of ritualistic futurism.

### Hyprland

-   Subtle blur
-   Slight neon-purple border for active window
-   Dim inactive windows
-   Rounded corners
-   Animations

### Waybar

-   Cockpit‑style segmentation
-   Optional small symbols
-   Gridlike or panel-based layout

### Terminal

-   Catppuccin Macchiato theme
-   Prompt styled as a ceremonial cyber‑operator interface
-   May include sigils, arrows, geometric separators
-   Informational but atmospheric banner text

### Rofi/Wofi

-   Styled like a mobile suit OS menu
-   Soft neon-purple glow
-   Simple shapes, clean lists
-   Optional blueprint-like borders

### Wallpaper Direction

Rotate sets featuring: 
1. Shadow Spears or Raven Guard silhouettes
2. Mecha or Gundam lineart (blueprint, schematic)
3. Cyberpunk rainy-glass cityscapes or neon reflections
4. Sacred-technology symbols

Color palettes must stay compatible with Macchiato purples.

## 7. Overall Intent

When generating or modifying dotfiles, AI should: 
- Preserve the Catppuccin Macchiato foundation
- Enhance the Shadow Spears purple‑accent theme
- Blend WH40K, Gundam, and Cyberpunk influences subtly
- Reinforce a unified identity of stealth, ritual, and technological
precision
- Prioritize coherence and usability
- Maintain the aesthetic of a ceremonial tactical interface operated by
Corvus

This style guide defines the creative identity for the
*archeotech-dotfiles* project. These ideas are all for inspiration, other ones can be proposed or alternatives.
